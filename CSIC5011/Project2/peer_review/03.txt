03. LIU, Di, Meilan WANG, Xu HAN. Order the Faces via Manifold Learning.

In this work, authors used manifold learning methods to explore the face ordering task, the ordering performance evaluation and embedding visualization are conducted among 9 methods, further authors also discussed the influence of different neighbor number on ordering and low dimensional embeddings.


Strengths: This work is well written and presented, evaluations are complete and relatively thorough comparing to other groups in the same topic. It is a good work combining the efforts by three authors.

Weakness: No discussion on why t-SNE is not well performed in this task.

Evaluation on quality of writing (5): This poster is well organized, and figures are clear enough to demonstrate the author¡¯s idea.
Evaluation on presentation (4): Good presentation which clearly conveyed their idea and explain the experiment design and their conclusion.

Evaluation on creativity (4): Beyond comparing the ordering performance on 9 methods, authors also explore the relationship between parameters like number of neighbors on ordering performance and embeddings.
