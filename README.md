* [Course Website](https://yao-lab.github.io/2019_csic5011/) 
* Instructor: [Prof. YAO Yuan](https://yao-lab.github.io/)
* Description: 

        This course is a mathematical introduction to data analysis and visualization with a perspective of topology and geometry. Topics covered include: classical linear dimensionality reduction, the principal component analysis (PCA) and its dual multidimensional scaling (MDS). Extensive application examples in biology, finance, and information technology are presented along with course projects.

## ELEC5650 - Sensing, Estimation & Control

* Instructor: [Prof. SHI Ling](https://eesling.home.ece.ust.hk)
* Description:
```
The course gives an introduction to the analysis and design of sensing, estimation and control systems in a networked setting. It consists of three parts: the first part introduces necessary background knowledge in communication networks, sensor networks, linear state estimation, MAP and ML estimators, Kalman filtering, and modern control theory; the second part focuses on analysis of network effect to remote state estimation and control; the third part presents some advanced topics including distributed state estimation and resource allocation through scheduling.

## ELEC5140 - Advanced Computer Architecture
* Instructor: [Prof. ZHANG Wei](https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/)
* Description:
```
The course introduces the important building blocks in modern computing systems including superscalar processor pipeline, memory hierarchies, network design in the multicore‐processors. The design techniques, evaluation metrics and optimization techniques will be discussed in detail with the example of real computer systems. The students will gain not only theoretical knowledge through lectures, but also hands‐on experiences through projects.

## ELEC6910R - Robotic Perception and Learning
* Instructor: [Prof. LIU Ming](https://ram-lab.com/)
* Description:
```
This course introduces the essential theoretical frameworks, methods, concepts, tools and techniques used to enable robotic perception and behavior, with particular emphasis on applications in autonomous mobile robots. The course starts from Bayesian programming and probabilistic methods, and then moves on to cover generic machine learning, especially deep learning. It also includes coverage of reinforcement learning. Important libraries for hand-on experiments for mobile robotic systems will be introduced. The students will have the opportunity to test their algorithms and implementations on real platforms.
